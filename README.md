**Photography:** a picture is worth a thousand words. I have been learning photography since 2016 and I am very fond of manual lenses. Thanks to the short flange focal distance of mirrorless cameras and in-body optical image stabilization in Sony Cameras, I can use half-a-century-old lenses on modern digital cameras effectively and create some beautiful images full of character.

|Camera| Sony A7III, Canon 70D, Canon 5D Mark I|
|Canon Lenses||
|Sony Lenses||
|Manual Lenses|Minolta, Helios, Pentacon, Yashica, Industar, Super Takumar, Vivitar, Voigtlander Nokton|
|Adapters|Sigma MC11, Fotga (M42 to NEX/ MD to NEX, M42 to EF, C to NEX), M42 Extension tubes|

**Audiophile:** as a strong proponent of consuming anything in pure form, music cannot be any different. During the pandemic, I really missed live music performances and hence decided to get a similar sound stage and imaging at home. Also while flying or in local transit, I love the quiet offered by noise-cancelling headphones.

|Category| Tools|

|Active Speaker| KEF LSX|
|Passive Speakers| Bluesound Powernode 2i driving ELAC Debut Reference Speakers|
|Over ear|Audio Technica ATH-M50X, Sony WH-1000XM3|
|In ear|Sony WF-1000XM4|

**Mechanical Watches** have been fascinated by them of late!


**Brewing Coffee** love brewing expresso and have watched numerous [James Hoffmann](https://www.jameshoffmann.co.uk/) youtube videos during pandemic! Try to tweak my humble Delonghi coffee machine for the coarseness of grind and time to brew, whenever I lay my hands on a new variety of coffee beans.
