**Photography:**
a picture is worth a thousand words. I have been learning photography since 2016 and I am very fond of manual lenses. Thanks to the short flange focal distance of mirrorless cameras and in-body optical image stabilization in Sony Cameras, I can use half-a-century-old lenses on modern digital cameras effectively and create some beautiful images full of character and microcontrast.

**Audiophile:**
As a strong proponent of consuming anything in pure form, music cannot be any different. I try to get a similar sound stage and imaging at the home of what an artist intends in a recording studio. Also, while flying or in local transit, I love the quiet offered by the noise-canceling headphones.

**Mechanical Watches**
Mechanical watches symbolize a blend of intricate craftsmanship, timeless design, and a nod to tradition. Their appeal lies not just in their functionality but also in the artistry and engineering behind their construction. These watches don't just tell time; they tell a story of heritage, skill, and precision, appreciated by those who value the beauty of mechanical complexity over digital simplicity.

* I have a Tudor Black Bay that I really love and goes well with casuals and formals alike
* Next on my to buy list is Rolex Explorer (black dial). I like the simplicity and elegance it carries.

**Coffee**
love brewing expresso and have watched numerous [James Hoffmann](https://www.jameshoffmann.co.uk/) youtube videos during pandemic! Try to tweak my humble Delonghi coffee machine for the coarseness of grind and time to brew, whenever I lay my hands on a new variety of coffee beans.


**Mechanical Keyboard**
a mechanical keyboard is a must have productivity tool for someone who has to type for hours.

I use the following
* Keychron K2
  * brown switch
  * bluetooth
* Akko ACR Pro 75
  * Gasket Mount
  * Smooth like butter!


**Perfumes**
Perhaps another pandemic-driven proclivity is love for perfumes. I tried and purchased many new fragrances that I never forayed into earlier. Aficionado of [Alberto Morillas](https://www.firmenich.com/fragrance/fine-fragrance/people/alberto-morillas). 40% of my blind buy perfumes in the past has been his perfumes.
