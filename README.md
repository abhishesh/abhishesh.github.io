**Photography:** a picture is worth a thousand words. I have been learning photography since 2016 and I am very fond of manual lenses. Thanks to the short flange focal distance of mirrorless cameras and in-body optical image stabilization in Sony Cameras, I can use half-a-century-old lenses on modern digital cameras effectively and create some beautiful images full of character and microcontrast.

**Audiophile:** As a strong proponent of consuming anything in pure form, music cannot be any different. I try to get a similar sound stage and imaging at the home of what an artist intends in a recording studio. Also, while flying or in local transit, I love the quiet offered by the noise-canceling headphones.

|Category|Tools|

|Active Speaker|KEF LSX|
|Passive Speakers| Bluesound Powernode 2i driving ELAC Debut Reference Speakers|
|Over-ear hedphones|Audio Technica ATH-M50X, Sony WH-1000XM3|
|In-ear headphones|Sony WF-1000XM4|

**Mechanical Watches** have been fascinated by them of late!

**Brewing Coffee** love brewing expresso and have watched numerous [James Hoffmann](https://www.jameshoffmann.co.uk/) youtube videos during pandemic! Try to tweak my humble Delonghi coffee machine for the coarseness of grind and time to brew, whenever I lay my hands on a new variety of coffee beans.

**Mechanical Keyboard** a mechanical keyboard is a must have productivity tool for someone who has to type for hours.

I use the following

* Keychron K2
  * brown switch
  * bluetooth
* Akko ACR Pro 75 - Gasket Mount!

**Perfumes** Perhaps another pandemic-driven proclivity is love for perfumes. I tried and purchased many new fragrances that I never forayed into earlier. Aficionado of [Alberto Morillas](https://www.firmenich.com/fragrance/fine-fragrance/people/alberto-morillas). 40% of my blind buy perfumes in the past has been his perfumes.
